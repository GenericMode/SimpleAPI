actress askin\u0027 me what happened, you\nThat\u0027s what happened, you\nYou who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes\nSippin\u0027 coffee like you\u0027re on a late-night show\nBut then he

jokes, but the punch line goes\n\u0022I\u0027ll get older, but your lovers stay my age\u0022\nFrom when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones\nI\u0027m a soldier who\u0027s returning half her weight\nAnd did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you too?\n\u0027Cause in this city\u0027s barren cold\nI still remember the first fall of snow\nAnd how it glistened as it fell\nI remember it all too well\n\n[Outro]\nJust between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?\nJust between us, do you remember it all too well?\nJust between us, I
